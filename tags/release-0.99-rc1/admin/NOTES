Notes to myself about how things should work...

DEPENDENCIES:

 - Modules must be loaded before switching back to X (eg, psmouse).

 - Bootsplash can't happen while X is the current VT (not enforced, but
   recommended in help).

 - Bootsplash needs to enable & disable itself on the swsusp VT manually.

 - Console lock must occur on a VT without bootsplash, else we can't see it.

 - Must support swsusps that chvt themselves, or not.

THINGS TO TEST:

All config options
Ctrl+C
/sbin/modprobe preserved

AlwaysForce = no works (scriptlet function exit codes)

Verify output from list-hooks.sh makes sense.

dash/zsh compatibility
