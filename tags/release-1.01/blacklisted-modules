# WARNING: No attempt is made to preserve this file upon upgrades.
#          The file format may also change between hibernate script versions.
#          It is recommended that you enter any modules you wish to unload
#          into hibernate.conf.
# 
# The syntax of each line in this file is "module name [...]" where [...] is
# a sequence of minimum/maximum kernel version pairs that the module is
# incompatible with. For example:
#     usb-ehci 2.4.0 2.4.25 2.6.0 2.6.2
# (would indicate that usb-ehci was incompatible in 2.4 until 2.4.25, and in
# 2.6 until 2.6.2 - example only!)
#
# A module without any versions is universally considered unsuspendable.
#
# This format has many limitations - it does not take into account Software
# Suspend 2 versions (which may include driver updates), or driver versions
# (eg, the nvidia driver).
