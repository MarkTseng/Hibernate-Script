0.95 (21 July 2004)
 - Install distributed scriptlets into /usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   Locally installed scriptlets can go into either /etc/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   or /usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d. Distribution packages can use
   /usr/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d. All three are searched.

   hibernate.conf and hibernate.log for consistency.

   longer required in scriptlets. New option LogVerbosity.
 - Cause abort if module unloading fails. (Cameron Patrick)
 - New (cleaner) method of launching fake X server.

 - Lots of speed improvements for faster start up time! (Bash scripts shouldn't
   *have* a startup time :)
