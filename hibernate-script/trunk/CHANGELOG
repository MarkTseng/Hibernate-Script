0.97 (30 July 2004)
 - Added lilo scriptlet to ensure the current kernel boots next time to resume.
   (inspired by Fedor Karpelevitch).
 - Added the Mount option to mount filesystems after resume.
 - More experimental bootsplash fixes for universal bootsplash support.
 - Fix overgenerous module unloading.
 - Detect new /proc root (/proc/software_suspend/) for >= 2.0.0.102.
 - Make LogVerbosity option actually work.

0.96 (24 July 2004)
 - Make the --config-file= option work once again (oops!)
 - Added the lock scriptlet for locking KDE, XScreensaver or the entire system
   via vlock.
 - Minor bootsplash cleanups.

0.95.1 (23 July 2004)
 - Fixed misclaunch scripts always failing bug.

0.95 (21 July 2004)
 - Install distributed scriptlets into /usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   Locally installed scriptlets can go into either /etc/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   or /usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d. Distribution packages can use
   /usr/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d. All three are searched.
 - Added AlternateGrubMenuFile option.
 - Added devices scriptlet for defining suspend-incompatible devices (eg,
   /dev/dsp) using IncompatibleDevices option. (Carsten Rietzschel)
 - Added /sys/power/state scriptlet sysfs_power_state as an alternative to
   swsusp2. (Cameron Patrick)
 - Added -n option to be equivalent to --no-suspend.
 - Added --dry-run option to just list what would get done.
 - Don't hardcode /sbin/splash.
 - Fixed Bootsplash and LeaveXBeforeSuspend interactions.
 - Don't assume /proc/swsusp/reboot exists (2.0 w/o debug doesn't have it).
 - Generate and install man pages.
 - Created a vim syntax highlighting spec file

0.94 (12 July 2004)
 - Turn off "AlwaysForce yes" in the default config file.
 - Make switching back to X occur before networking and services, to give the
   impression that resuming is faster ;) (Cameron Patrick)
 - Take more care with scriptlet return values to make Ctrl+C actually work whn
   not using --force.

0.93 (11 July 2004 (later that evening))
 - Make Ctrl+C abort cleanly again.
 - chown the right directory in the installer.
 - Licensed under GPLv2.

0.92 (11 July 2004)
 - /etc/suspend/, suspend.conf, and swsusp.log are now called /etc/hibernate/,
   hibernate.conf and hibernate.log for consistency.
 - Redirect stderr to stdout so that both get logged. $LOGPIPE is also no
   longer required in scriptlets. New option LogVerbosity.
 - Cause abort if module unloading fails. (Cameron Patrick)
 - New (cleaner) method of launching fake X server.
 - Disable module loading during suspend.
 - Lots of speed improvements for faster start up time! (Bash scripts shouldn't
   *have* a startup time :)

0.91 (9 July 2004 (later that day))
 - Multiple fixes for grub - restoring the grub menu is now achieved by using
   "hibernate -g" or "hibernate --restore-grub", not by running the scriptlet.
 - Extend NN range for scripts to 00-99.
 - Bleeding obvious bugfixes to bootsplash, misclaunch and modules scriptlets.
 - Avoid sourcing editor backup files (ignore scriptlets *~ *.bak).
 - ash compatibility fix in install script.
 - Remove some unnecessary sleep calls.
 - Thanks to Cameron Patrick and Carsten Rietzschel for most of these fixes.

0.9 (9 July 2004)
 - First public release.
