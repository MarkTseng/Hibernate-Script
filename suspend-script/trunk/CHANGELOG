0.92
 - /etc/suspend/, suspend.conf, and swsusp.log are now called /etc/hibernate/,
   hibernate.conf and hibernate.log for consistency.
 - Redirect stderr to stdout so that both get logged. $LOGPIPE is also no
   longer required in scriptlets.
 - Cause abort if module unloading fails. (Cameron Patrick)
 - Lots of speed improvements!

0.91 (9 July 2004 (later that day))
 - Multiple fixes for grub - restoring the grub menu is now achieved by using
   "hibernate -g" or "hibernate --restore-grub", not by running the scriptlet.
 - Extend NN range for scripts to 00-99.
 - Bleeding obvious bugfixes to bootsplash, misclaunch and modules scriptlets.
 - Avoid sourcing editor backup files (ignore scriptlets *~ *.bak).
 - ash compatibility fix in install script.
 - Remove some unnecessary sleep calls.
 - Thanks to Cameron Patrick and Carsten Rietzschel for most of these fixes.

0.9 (9 July 2004)
 - First public release.
