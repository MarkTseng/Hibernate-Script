0.95 ()
 - Don't assume /proc/swsusp/reboot exists (2.0 w/o debug doesn't have it)
 - Install distributed scriptlets into /usr/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   Locally installed scriptlets can go into either /etc/hibernate/scriptlets.d
   or /usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d
 - Added AlternateGrubMenuFile option.

0.94 (12 July 2004)
 - Turn off "AlwaysForce yes" in the default config file.
 - Make switching back to X occur before networking and services, to give the
   impression that resuming is faster ;) (Cameron Patrick)
 - Take more care with scriptlet return values to make Ctrl+C actually work whn
   not using --force.

0.93 (11 July 2004 (later that evening))
 - Make Ctrl+C abort cleanly again.
 - chown the right directory in the installer.
 - Licensed under GPLv2.

0.92 (11 July 2004)
 - /etc/suspend/, suspend.conf, and swsusp.log are now called /etc/hibernate/,
   hibernate.conf and hibernate.log for consistency.
 - Redirect stderr to stdout so that both get logged. $LOGPIPE is also no
   longer required in scriptlets. New option LogVerbosity.
 - Cause abort if module unloading fails. (Cameron Patrick)
 - New (cleaner) method of launching fake X server.
 - Disable module loading during suspend.
 - Lots of speed improvements for faster start up time! (Bash scripts shouldn't
   *have* a startup time :)

0.91 (9 July 2004 (later that day))
 - Multiple fixes for grub - restoring the grub menu is now achieved by using
   "hibernate -g" or "hibernate --restore-grub", not by running the scriptlet.
 - Extend NN range for scripts to 00-99.
 - Bleeding obvious bugfixes to bootsplash, misclaunch and modules scriptlets.
 - Avoid sourcing editor backup files (ignore scriptlets *~ *.bak).
 - ash compatibility fix in install script.
 - Remove some unnecessary sleep calls.
 - Thanks to Cameron Patrick and Carsten Rietzschel for most of these fixes.

0.9 (9 July 2004)
 - First public release.
