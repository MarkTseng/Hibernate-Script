TITLE=Software Suspend - Optional Extras
<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>"Options" patches extend the functionality of Software Suspend, but depend
on other patches which are not normally found in the vanilla kernels.

<p>For the 2.1 release of Software Suspend, there are no available option
patches, largely because most of the code they depended on has been merged into
the mainstream kernel and support has been merged into the main release of
Software Suspend (eg, XFS, ACPI, Laptop mode). Bootsplash option patches may
become available soon.

<p>The following information was current for version 2.0 of swsusp.<!-- Please refer to the
<tt>Applying</tt> file within the tarball for the latest information on option
patches.--></p>

<h2><a href="http://www.bootsplash.org/">Bootsplash</a></h2>

<p>Bootsplash support allows you to have a graphical boot process for your
Linux machine. The optional patch for software suspend (called
<tt>bootsplash-option</tt>) will make software suspend utilise the progress bar
of bootsplash rather than the default text progress screen that is normally
shown. <b>It is only required if you are using version 1 or 2 bootsplash
images.</b> If you have a version 3 bootsplash image, you do not need this
patch. Apply this option patch after applying the one from bootsplash.org</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.netraverse.com/">Win4Lin</a></h2>

<p>Win4Lin is a commercial program that allows you to run Windows(TM) under
Linux.  The <tt>patch-swsusp-win4lin</tt> patch allows you suspend whilst running
Win4Lin.</p>
