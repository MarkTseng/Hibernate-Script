TITLE=Software Suspend - Optional Extras
<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>There are several "Options" available for software suspend - these patches
extend the functionality, but depend on other patches which are not normally
found in the vanilla kernels. These patches are contained within the swsusp
tarball obtained from the download page.</p>

<p>This information is current for version 2.0 of swsusp.<!-- Please refer to the
<tt>Applying</tt> file within the tarball for the latest information on option
patches.--></p>

<h2><a href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/">ACPI</a><b> option is no longer needed.</b></h2>

<!--
<p>Using ACPI with software suspend may be more reliable on some machines as
ACPI uses it's own mechanisms to notify the hardware of the oncoming suspend.
Apply the ACPI option patch (called <tt>acpi-option</tt>) <i>after</i> you
have applied a recent ACPI patch from the
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/acpi/">ACPI project page</a>
(tested with 20030523 and 20030619).</p> -->

<h2><a href="http://www.bootsplash.org/">Bootsplash</a></h2>

<p>Bootsplash support allows you to have a graphical boot process for your
Linux machine. The optional patch for software suspend (called
<tt>bootsplash-option</tt>) will make software suspend utilise the progress bar
of bootsplash rather than the default text progress screen that is normally
shown. <b>It is only required if you are using version 1 or 2 bootsplash
images.</b> If you have a version 3 bootsplash image, you do not need this
patch. Apply this option patch after applying the one from bootsplash.org</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.netraverse.com/">Win4Lin</a></h2>

<p>Win4Lin is a commercial program that allows you to run Windows(TM) under
Linux.  The <tt>patch-swsusp-win4lin</tt> patch allows you suspend whilst running
Win4Lin.</p>

<h2>Laptop mode <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/32037/">(description)</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/32520/">(latest original patch)</a></h2>
<p><b><i>NOTE:</i></b> Laptop mode has been integrated in the 2.4 kernel series
since 2.4.23 and this is no longer required if you are using 2.4.23 or later.</p>
<p>Laptop mode is a patch written by Jens Axboe that adds a noticeable amount
of battery life to a laptop, by holding data to be written to the disk until a
certain amount of time has elapsed or a read is required - thus not spinning up
the hard disk unnecessarily. The <tt>laptop-option</tt> patch is the modified
version of the patch that integrates with software suspend. This option patch
does <b>not</b> require the original patch be applied to the kernel.<br>
<b>WARNING:</b> Using this patch increases the risk of data loss in the case of
unexpected power, software or hardware failures.</p>

<h2><a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/">XFS support</a></h2>
<p>If you have XFS partitions, then you will need this patch to be able to
suspend properly. The patches are created
against recent snapshot versions of the XFS code by
<a href="mailto:&#115;&#122;&#105;&#119;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#112;&#108;">Karol Kozimor</a>,
and must be applied after the XFS patch, but before software suspend.
