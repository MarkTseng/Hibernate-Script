TITLE=Software Suspend - Status

<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
Known issues with Software Suspend 2.1 are as follows:
<ul>
<li>DRI support is lacking power management support under 2.4 &amp; 2.6.</li>
<li>AGP support under 2.6 is partially implemented.</li>
<li>USB support under 2.4 and 2.6 is partially implemented.</li>
<li>Other drivers have varying degrees of power management support.</li>
<li>There is currently no support for discontig memory.</li>
<li>Suspend currently requires the PSE extension (check /proc/cpuinfo).</li>
<li>Highmem &gt; 4GB is currently not supported.</li>
</ul>

Some of these issues have work-arounds available: check the FAQs for details.

<h2>Hardware support</h2>

<p>Software suspend currently supports only x86 based hardware, and requires a
CPU with pse or pse36 support. This excludes CPUs such as the VIA C3, but
almost all other modern Intel and AMD CPUs should be supported.</p>

<p>You may have hardware that does not support power management events
sufficiently well (or at all). In this case, the best option (if possible) is
to compile the drivers for the hardware as modules and unload them before
suspend. This works best in the case of nVidia graphics cards, sound cards, USB
drivers, PCMCIA, network drivers, etc.</p>

<h2>2.4 kernels</h2>

<p>The last major update to Software Suspend 2 for the 2.4 kernel series was
2.1.5.7B. Except for forward porting and bugfixes, no further work will be done
on the 2.4 series. People have been running 2.1.5.7B for some time quite
happily so if problems arise, they are most likely driver issues.</p>

<h2>2.2 kernels</h2>
<p>Patches for the 2.2 series kernels have not been updated for a long time. If you
<i>really</i> need software suspend under 2.2, you can download the outdated patch from
<a href="http://fchabaud.free.fr/English/Tricks/Laptop/Swsusp/patch-2.2.20-swsusp.gz">here</a>. 
Be warned - if you run into problems, it is likely nobody will help you.
