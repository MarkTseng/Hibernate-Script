<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Posting policy on swsusp-devel<br>
<pre>
Due to increasing spamming on the swsusp-devel list and the fact that instances
of SOBIG worm have been found in some of the posts, I had to enable the
limitation of posting to subscribed members only. Please, subscribe to the list
in order to be able to post.
	   
Sorry for the inconvenience.
