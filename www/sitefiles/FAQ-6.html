</H2>

<P>Plenty! SCSI is not supported if used on root/swap partitions, only IDE. A
lot of hardware is not restored properly, including some graphic chipsets. This
means that this hardware is in a different state upon resume than the kernel
thinks it is. For the kernel, the hardware is reinitialized although it has
been reset by BIOS. Sometimes, this may be solved by setting the BIOS option
(if it exists) to non PnP OS.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc6.2">Swsusp seems nice, but can I use it for doing snapshots?</A>
</H2>

<P>No you can't because the image you save is linked to your filesystem state,
including root. You can only do that if the two systems are completely
independent. It may be possible (but not guaranteed) that you could do that if
your root partition is mounted read-only and you unmount all other read-write
devices before suspending, but that would have absolutely no interest IMHO.</P>
