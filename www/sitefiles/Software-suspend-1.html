</H2>

<P>Software suspend is the ability to take a snapshot of the state of a
computer's memory and save it to disk, and restore that image later.
This allows you to fully power down a computer at an arbitrary point in
time and not need to reload programs and reopen documents on power-up.
In modern laptops, suspension is not done by the BIOS. They use ACPI and
ask the operating system to do most of the job. If you can't satisfy
yourself with standby mode (suspension to RAM) because you leave your
computer in suspension mode for too long (or because you're not using a
2.5 or later kernel and therefore lack suspend-to-RAM support), then you
have to suspend on disk.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="Software-suspend.html#toc1.3">Why was this document written?</A>
</H2>

<P>Software suspend has a long story, but for a long time it was considered
as alpha. This is mainly due to the fact that suspension has to deal
with a lot of aspects in kernel. It is therefore difficult to follow the
kernel development (for instance transition from 2.2 to 2.4 was not
straightforward). The 2.4 patch is now considered stable. If you have a
single-processor machine with Pentium like CPU and ide disks, it is very
likely that swsusp will perform correctly. However, installing,
configuring and using software suspension is not straightforward, since
it involves recompiling the kernel and setting some boot parameters.
