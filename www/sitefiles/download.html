TITLE=Software Suspend - Obtaining It

Quick links:

<li><a href="olddownloads.html">All available downloads at Berlios (current and older patches)</a>
</ul>

<h2>Development versions</h2>
The latest development versions are posted to the <a href="lists.html">mailing
lists</a> and also potentially are in the <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios
Download Page</a>, under "Current Beta Patches". If you use these patches, you
should keep up to date with the mailing list for any known problems that may
arise.

<h2>Stable versions</h2>
<p>Software suspend comes as a tarball of patches, which must all be applied
to your kernel. Each tarball is for a specific kernel version. There is also an
apply script inside the tarball to make applying the patches in order easier,
and will back out the patches if it detects that they will not apply cleanly.

<p>
The <a href="HOWTO.html">HOWTO</a> has detailed instructions on
patching and recompiling your kernel.

<h2>Older versions</h2>
<p>Patches against older kernels are available from the
<a href="olddownloads.html">Older Downloads</a> section.  These are generally
unsupported though, and the archives are the best reference if you plan to use
these.
<p>For really old work, you can consult the
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/">SourceForge archives</a>
but again be warned that nobody will be likely to help you.
