TITLE=Software Suspend - Obtaining It

<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<h2>Development versions</h2>
The latest development versions are posted to the <a href="lists.html">mailing
lists</a> and also potentially are in the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios Download Page</a>, near the bottom under "Test Patches". If you use these patches, you should keep up to date with
the mailing list for any known problems that may arise.

<h2>Stable versions</h2>
<p>Software suspend comes as pair of patches - one <i>version specific</i>
patch which is particular to a particular kernel version. This must be applied
first. The second is the core patch which is the same for all kernel versions,
and must be applied second. The <a href="Software-suspend.html">HOWTO</a> has
detailed instructions on patching and recompiling your kernel.
