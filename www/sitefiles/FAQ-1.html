</H2>

<P>Visit the 
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios download page</A>.
Under the <B>Current Beta Patches</B> package, grab the latest full tarball
(called software-suspend-XXX-for-YYY.tar.gz) for the releveant kernel.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.2">How do I get the latest stable Software Suspend 2?</A>
</H2>

<P>Visit the 
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios download page</A>.
Under the <B>Current Kernel Patches</B> package, grab the latest core patch
<B>and</B> latest version-specific patch for your kernel version.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.3">What kernel do I need for the latest Software Suspend 2?</A>
</H2>

<P>For the 2.4 series, you will need a relatively clean 2.4.24 kernel source
tree (eg, not Red Hat's kernel source). There are a number of optional patches
that are convenient if you have extras in your kernel such as 
<A HREF="http://www.bootsplash.org/">bootsplash</A> (not always needed, see 
<A HREF="FAQ-5.html#bootsplash">Bootsplash help</A>)
<A HREF="http://www.netraverse.com/">Win4Lin</A>
or 
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/32037/">laptop-mode</A>
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/Articles/32520/">(updated version)</A>. If you
have any of these, you might want to download the relevant option patch which
helps Software Suspend 2 integrate nicely.</P>

<P>2.6 kernels come with their own version of Software Suspend (referred to on
the mailing lists as Software Suspend v1). This is in the process of being
merged with Nigel's work on Software Suspend 2 (referred as v2, or swsusp2).
Generally speaking, more people have had success with Software Suspend 2 than
the stock kernel version in 2.6.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc1.4">How can I tell what version of Software Suspend my distro's stock kernel came with?</A>
</H2>

<P>Run dmesg after boot, and search for any messages containing 'swsusp' or
'Software Suspend'. There should be a version number listed. Distribution
kernels generally differ greatly from the vanilla kernels, and people testing
and developing software suspend will not be using them. Hence people may
be less likely to help when dealing with unknowns.</P>
