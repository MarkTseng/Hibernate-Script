TITLE=Software Suspend for Linux

<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>Software Suspend is most easily described as the Linux equivalent of
Windows' hibernate functionality. It saves the contents of memory to
disk and powers down. When the computer is started up again, it reloads
the contents and the user can continue from where they left off. No
documents need to be reloaded or applications reopened and the process
is much faster than a normal shutdown and start up.</p>

<p class="Note"><a href="#2.1.2">Software Suspend 2.1.2 for Linux 2.6 is out!</a></p>

<p>Software Suspend has a long <a href="features.html">feature list</a>,
including the ability to cancel a suspend by pressing Escape, image compression
to save time or space, a versatile plugin architecture, and support for
machines with Highmem, preemption and SMP.

<p>The Software Suspend website (this one) and <a href="lists.html">mailing
list</a> provide support for dealing with issues arising. An IRC channel
<tt>#swsusp</tt> has been created on irc.freenode.net, where people may be able
to help you with problems.</p>

<p>A huge thanks must go to Nigel Cunningham, Florent Chabaud, Pavel Machek,
Gabor Kuti, and Michael Frank along with many others who have tested and
contributed to the development of Software Suspend.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>You will always find the latest version of Software Suspend on the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios download page</a>.

<a name="2.1.2"></a><b>6 November 2004: Software Suspend 2.1.2 - yet-another-release!</b>
<p><b><i>Important:</i></b> In order to facilitate initramfs and
early-userspace support, this release (and onwards) uses <tt>do_suspend</tt>
and <tt>do_resume</tt> in place of the original <tt>activate</tt> entry in
<tt>/proc/software_suspend/</tt>. This means you will have to modify your
hibernate script (or grab the latest
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/softwaresuspend/hibernate-script-1.00-rc2.tar.gz">hibernate script v1.00-rc2</a>),
and your initrd script also if you are using modular Software Suspend.</p>

<p>This release includes a fix for an Oops when aborting whilst writing kernel
and process data, extra improvements on SMP, I/O routines, and more.<br>

<a name="2.1"></a><b>20 October 2004: Software Suspend 2.1 for Kernel 2.6.9</b>
<p>It's been far from quiet in the last few months as Nigel has been working
tirelessly on Software Suspend 2, and towards getting it merged into the
mainstream kernel. Software Suspend 2.1 is the latest release to be officially
marked as stable (though people have been running development patches for some
time quite happily!).</p>

<p>This version includes tons of changes since 2.0, possibly most importantly,
the ability to build Software Suspend 2 as modules. This allows it to be loaded
from an initrd, opening up <a href="FAQ-6.html#ss6.1">all sorts of
possibilities</a>.</p>

<p>We're making the switch to

The <a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a> have also changed; please see the

</p>

<a name="wiki"></a><b>4 July 2004: Wiki created</b>
<p>A <a href="wiki/">wiki</a> has been created for sharing information relevant
to Software Suspend 2. Such items include hardware compatibility, known issues
with compilers, known issues with certain patch versions, etc. It is not a
place to ask questions - they belong on the <a href="lists.html">mailing
list</a>. Please keep it tidy :)

<a name="2.0_2.4.26"></a><b>12 June 2004: Version specific patch for 2.4.26</b>
<p>While the development of Software Suspend 2 has been very active, until now
the only patches available for 2.4.26 were test patches. A patch for the 2.0
release has been created for 2.4.26, and is available

<p>For those not-quite-bleeding-edge junkies that want to hear about the latest,
but not be flooded by a mass of bug reports and discussion, a new mailing list
has been created. The <tt>swsusp-announce</tt> list will be very low volume,
with only announcements of new versions of Software Suspend, patches, and
suspend scripts. <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/swsusp-announce">Click here to subscribe.</a>
</p>

<a name="2.0"></a><b>30 January 2004: Software Suspend hits 2.0!</b>
<p>Software Suspend 2.0 for Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels is now available. The
2.0 release is a major advance over previous versions and includes the following
features:
<ul>
<li>Support for Highmem (up to 4GB), SMP (on 2.4, 2.6 soon) and preemptive kernels.</li>
<li>Support for any number of swap partitions and/or files.</li>
<li>Full asynchronous I/O and readahead for synchronous I/O for maximum throughput.</li>
<li>Image compression (LZF and GZIP - the former is very fast and highly recommended).</li>
<li>Support for saving a full image of your memory, resulting in a fast, responsive system after resuming.</li>
<li>Support for plugins: data transformers (compression, encryption) and new storage backends (NFS support is planned).</li>
<li>Nice user interface (<a href="http://www.bootsplash.org">Bootsplash</a> compatible).</li>
<li>The ability to specify a maximum image size.</li>
<li>The ability to cancel a suspend by pressing Escape (for security, this can be disabled).</li>
<li>Speed and reliability - Software Suspend 2.0 has been extensively tested in a variety of configurations over many months. It is not guaranteed to be perfect, but bugs found will be hunted and fixed quickly.</li>
</ul>
This website includes extensive documentation, including 
<a href="status.html">known issues</a> (primarily DRI and USB support) and
FAQs. A well-used <a href="lists.html">mailing list</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Note that two patches are required to use suspend: one for the particular 
kernel version you are using and a second (applied afterwards) contains the core
files.</p>

<p>Special thanks go to Michael Frank for many months of extensive testing of the
code, to Marc Lehmann for the work on the LZF compressor, and to Bernard Blackham
for maintaining the website and especially to <a href="http://www.linuxfund.org">LinuxFund.org</a> for their sponsorship of the project, which has allowed me to 
work full time on Software Suspend over the last four months.<br>
