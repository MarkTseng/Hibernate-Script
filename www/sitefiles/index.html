<p>Software Suspend is most easily described as the Linux equivalent of
Windows' hibernate functionality. It saves the contents of memory to
disk and powers down. When the computer is started up again, it reloads
the contents and the user can continue from where they left off. No
documents need to be reloaded or applications reopened and the process
is much faster than a normal shutdown and start up.</p>

<p class="Note"><a href="#2.1.7">Software Suspend 2.1.7 for Linux 2.6 is out!</a></p>

<p>Software Suspend 2 has a long <a href="###BASE###features">feature list</a>,
including the ability to cancel a suspend by pressing Escape, image compression
to save time or space, a versatile plugin architecture, and support for
machines with Highmem, preemption and SMP.

<p>The Software Suspend 2 website (this one) and <a href="###BASE###lists">mailing
list</a> provide support for dealing with issues arising. An IRC channel
<tt>#swsusp</tt> has been created on irc.freenode.net, where people may be able
to help you with problems.</p>

<p>The primary author of Software Suspend 2 is Nigel Cunningham. A huge thanks
must also go to Florent Chabaud, Pavel Machek, Gabor Kuti, and Michael Frank
along with many others who have tested and contributed to the development of
Software Suspend.</p>

<h2>Current Versions</h2>

<p>You will always find the latest version of Software Suspend on the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1412">Berlios download page</a>.

<h2>Latest News</h2>

<a name="2.1.7"></a><b>14 February 2005: Software Suspend 2.1.7</b>
<p>Changes since 2.1.6 are minimal, but includes a fix for a potential source of
crashes upon resume, and limiting concurrent I/O transacations which may solve
some hangs whilst resuming. It also includes an alpha version of a userspace
user interface which will ultimately supercede the bootsplash module - details
on setting this up can be found on the wiki in
<a href="###WIKI_URL###UserUIHowto">UserUIHowto</a>.

<p><b><i>Important:</i></b> In order to facilitate initramfs and

and <tt>do_resume</tt> in place of the original <tt>activate</tt> entry in
<tt>/proc/software_suspend/</tt>. This means you will have to modify your
hibernate script (or grab the latest
<a href="http://download.berlios.de/softwaresuspend/hibernate-script-1.00-rc2.tar.gz">hibernate script v1.00-rc2</a>),
and your initrd script also if you are using modular Software Suspend.</p>

<p>This release includes a fix for an Oops when aborting whilst writing kernel
and process data, extra improvements on SMP, I/O routines, and more.<br>

<a name="2.1"></a><b>20 October 2004: Software Suspend 2.1 for Kernel 2.6.9</b>
<p>It's been far from quiet in the last few months as Nigel has been working
tirelessly on Software Suspend 2, and towards getting it merged into the
mainstream kernel. Software Suspend 2.1 is the latest release to be officially
marked as stable (though people have been running development patches for some
time quite happily!).</p>

<p>This version includes tons of changes since 2.0, possibly most importantly,
the ability to build Software Suspend 2 as modules. This allows it to be loaded
from an initrd, opening up <a href="###BASE###HOWTO-7#ss7.1">all sorts of
possibilities</a>.</p>
