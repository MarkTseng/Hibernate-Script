<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>Software Suspend is most easily described as the Linux equivalent of
Windows' hibernate functionality. It saves the contents of memory to
disk and powers down. When the computer is started up again, it reloads
the contents and the user can continue from where they left off. No
documents need to be reloaded or applications reopened and the process
is much faster than a normal shutdown and start up.</p>

<p class="Note"><a href="#2.1.5">Software Suspend 2.1.5 for Linux 2.6 is out!</a></p>

<p>Software Suspend has a long <a href="features.html">feature list</a>,
including the ability to cancel a suspend by pressing Escape, image compression
to save time or space, a versatile plugin architecture, and support for
machines with Highmem, preemption and SMP.

<p>The Software Suspend website (this one) and <a href="lists.html">mailing
list</a> provide support for dealing with issues arising. An IRC channel
<tt>#swsusp</tt> has been created on irc.freenode.net, where people may be able
to help you with problems.</p>

<p>A huge thanks must go to Nigel Cunningham, Florent Chabaud, Pavel Machek,
Gabor Kuti, and Michael Frank along with many others who have tested and
contributed to the development of Software Suspend.</p>

<a name="2.1"></a><b>20 October 2004: Software Suspend 2.1 for Kernel 2.6.9</b>
<p>It's been far from quiet in the last few months as Nigel has been working
tirelessly on Software Suspend 2, and towards getting it merged into the
mainstream kernel. Software Suspend 2.1 is the latest release to be officially
marked as stable (though people have been running development patches for some
time quite happily!).</p>

<p>This version includes tons of changes since 2.0, possibly most importantly,
the ability to build Software Suspend 2 as modules. This allows it to be loaded
from an initrd, opening up <a href="FAQ-6.html#ss6.1">all sorts of
possibilities</a>.</p>
