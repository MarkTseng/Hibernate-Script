TITLE=Software Suspend - Features
<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>Software Suspend's features include:
<ul>
<li>Image compression (LZF - very fast and highly recommended)</li>
<li>Full asynchronous I/O and readahead for synchronous I/O for maximum throughput</li>
<li>Support for any number of swap partitions and/or files.</li>
<li>The ability to cancel a suspend cycle (during suspending) by pressing escape</li>
<li>The ability to specify a maximum image size.</li>
<li>Support for saving a full image of your memory, resulting in a fast, responsive system after resuming</li>
<li>Support for plugins: data transformers (compression, encryption) and new storage backends (NFS support is planned).</li>
<li>Nice user interface (<a href="http://www.bootsplash.org">Bootsplash</a> compatible).</li>
<li>Support for Highmem (up to 4GB), SMP and preemptive kernels.</li>
<li>The ability to build Software Suspend 2 as modules, allowing it to be called from an initrd.</li>
<li>Speed and reliability - Software Suspend has been extensively tested in a variety of configurations over many months. It is not guaranteed to be perfect, but bugs found will be hunted and fixed quickly.
</ul>

<a name="compare"></a><h2>Suspend-to-disk implementations explained</h2>

<p>Since the original Software Suspend code was written by Gabor Kuti and
Pavel Machek back in 1998, three different implementations have been
created for the 2.6 kernel, all forks of the same original codebase. Here
is a quick comparison between the two that still exist. The first column refers
to CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND in the 2.6 kernel. <tt>pmdisk</tt> has been merged
back into the original swsusp implementation in the kernel, and hence is no
longer listed here.  The second column refers to what is now commonly called
"Software Suspend 2" and is what this site largely deals with.</p>
