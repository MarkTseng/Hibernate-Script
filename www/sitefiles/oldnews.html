<a name="2.0"></a><b>30 January 2004: Software Suspend hits 2.0!</b>
<p>Software Suspend 2.0 for Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels is now available. The
2.0 release is a major advance over previous versions and includes the following
features:
<ul>
<li>Support for Highmem (up to 4GB), SMP (on 2.4, 2.6 soon) and preemptive kernels.</li>
<li>Support for any number of swap partitions and/or files.</li>
<li>Full asynchronous I/O and readahead for synchronous I/O for maximum throughput.</li>
<li>Image compression (LZF and GZIP - the former is very fast and highly recommended).</li>
<li>Support for saving a full image of your memory, resulting in a fast, responsive system after resuming.</li>
<li>Support for plugins: data transformers (compression, encryption) and new storage backends (NFS support is planned).</li>
<li>Nice user interface (<a href="http://www.bootsplash.org">Bootsplash</a> compatible).</li>
<li>The ability to specify a maximum image size.</li>
<li>The ability to cancel a suspend by pressing Escape (for security, this can be disabled).</li>
<li>Speed and reliability - Software Suspend 2.0 has been extensively tested in a variety of configurations over many months. It is not guaranteed to be perfect, but bugs found will be hunted and fixed quickly.</li>
</ul>
This website includes extensive documentation, including 
<a href="###BASE###status">known issues</a> (primarily DRI and USB support) and
FAQs. A well-used <a href="###BASE###lists">mailing list</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Note that two patches are required to use suspend: one for the particular 
kernel version you are using and a second (applied afterwards) contains the core
files.</p>

<p>Special thanks go to Michael Frank for many months of extensive testing of the
code, to Marc Lehmann for the work on the LZF compressor, and to Bernard Blackham
for maintaining the website and especially to <a href="http://www.linuxfund.org">LinuxFund.org</a> for their sponsorship of the project, which has allowed me to 
work full time on Software Suspend over the last four months.<br>

<b>27 January 2003: swsusp 2.0-rc5 core patch</b>
<p>Nigel writes:
<i>Core patch 2.0rc5 is now available on Sourceforge. I'm really truly
expecting it to be the last rc. This is not to say that I think we've
got it completely bug free, but that it's close enough for me to feel
happy about calling it 2.0.  The main changes since rc4:</i>
<ul>
<li> Console printing calls reworked in response to discussions on LKML.</li>
<li> Initial SCSI support. Your mileage will vary, depending upon
how/whether your SCSI driver implemented power management support.</li>
<li> Confirmed success running on an 8 processor box (except that SCSI
power management was broken on the box, so I couldn't get past starting
to try to re-read the caches).</li>
<li> Fixed an issue with reserved Highmem pages causing an oops in
copy_pageset1.</li>
<li> Fixed preemption issues with 2.6.</li>
<li> Keys for debugging reworked so serial console and normal keyboard use
the same keys: P for pausing, S for single step, Space to continue when
paused.</li>
</ul>

<b>30 December 2003: Comparison table</b>
<p>A <a href="###BASE###features#compare">comparison table</a> has been compiled by Harry
Rockefeller and Nigel comparing the 3 different implementations available in
the 2.6 kernel and may clear up some confusion.</p>

<b>10 December 2003: swsusp 2.0-rc3 is out for 2.4 <i>AND</i> 2.6!</b>
<p>
No, it hasn't been quiet at all! Thanks to many test patches and our bleeding edge
testers, <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=swsusp-devel&m=107103023307010&w=2">Nigel has announced swsusp 2.0-rc3</a>. There are now two patches one needs to apply to
obtain swsusp. The first is a version-specific patch for your kernel, whether it
be
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-2.0-linux-2.4.23.bz2?download">2.4.23</a>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-2.0-linux-2.4.22.bz2?download">2.4.22</a>
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-2.0-linux-2.4.21.bz2?download">2.4.21</a> or
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-2.0-linux-2.6.0-test11-rev2.bz2?download">2.6.0-test11</a>.

The second is the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-2.0-core-rc3A.bz2?download">core patch</a>
to be applied regardless of your kernel version.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The kernel command line parameters have changed. <tt>resume=</tt>
and <tt>noresume</tt> have been deprecated, in favour of <tt>resume2=</tt> and
<tt>noresume2</tt> to avoid clashing with other 2.6 parameters, and which will
allow for alternate methods of storing the suspend image (eg, on an NFS mount)
in the future.  If your resume line currently reads <tt>resume=/dev/hda1</tt>
then it should be changed to <tt>resume2=swap:/dev/hda1</tt>. For swap files,
similar changes have occured - read 
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=swsusp-devel&m=107103023307010&w=2">Nigel's announcement</a> for the details.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, <tt>/proc/sys/kernel/swsusp</tt> has finally been moved into 
<tt>/proc/swsusp/all_settings</tt>. This means you will need to update your
suspend scripts accordingly too.

<b>9 October 2003: swsusp 2.0-rc1</b>
<p>
Due to the many substantial changes in swsusp since 1.0, it was decided that
the next release be called 2.0, not 1.1 as originally planned. There will be no
1.1 release.</p>
<p>This patch adds:
<ul>
<li>support for suspending lots of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=6202070">kernel daemons</a> (so that modules do not need to be unloaded)
<li>the Control key now acts as if the <tt>noresume</tt> option had been passed on the kernel command line
<li>a "softer" power down (switching off no longer ends in a "clunk" for some users)
<li>a slight speed increase
<li>more bugfixes &amp; code cleanups
</ul></p>

</p>

<b>18 September 2003: swsusp 1.1-rc9</b>
<p>
This patch fixes two bugs to vastly improve reliability, along with a
reworking of the freezer. It also introduces some extra options - one to allow
you to specify the expected compression of your swap image (so you no longer
require as much swap as the full uncompressed image size to be available).</p>

<p>
The second new option allows you to resume multiple times from the same suspend
image - this requires you have a read-only root partition that is identically
distributed across multiple machines on a network.
