<b>18 September 2003: swsusp 1.1-rc9</b>
<p>
This patch fixes two bugs to vastly improve reliability, along with a
reworking of the freezer. It also introduces some extra options - one to allow
you to specify the expected compression of your swap image (so you no longer
require as much swap as the full uncompressed image size to be available).</p>

<p>
The second new option allows you to resume multiple times from the same suspend
image - this requires you have a read-only root partition that is identically
distributed across multiple machines on a network.

<b>27 August 2003: IMPORTANT - Posting policy on swsusp-devel</b>

<b>19 August 2003: swsusp 1.1-rc5</b>
<p>This patch fixes the potential sync corruption (below), completes support
for <tt>8139too</tt> suspension, and moves the code from
<tt>kernel/suspend</tt> to <tt>kernel/power</tt> to be inline with the 2.6
kernel (hence it's large size).

to your current swsusp source to avoid corruption. This is also fixed in swsusp 1.1-rc5.
