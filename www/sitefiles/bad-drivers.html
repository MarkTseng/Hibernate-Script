TITLE=Software Suspend - Incompatible drivers

<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>There are a number of drivers in the kernel (or userland) which can not be
suspended, or require some magic to do so. If you're having problems, see 
if your driver is here and see if the information helps. If you notice some
information that is outdated or incorrect, please 
<a href="mailto:b-swweb@blackham.com.au">let me know</a>.</p>
