TITLE=Software Suspend for the Impatient

<h1>###TITLE###</h1>

<p>The abridged software suspend guide follows. Some knowledge is assumed -
everything here is explained in greater detail in the 
<a href="Software-suspend.html">HOWTO</a>. This only covers the most common case.</p>

<ol>

<li>Grab the latest "core" <b>AND</b> "version-specific" patches linked from
the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.</li>

<li>Apply the version-specific patch first, then the core patch.</li>

<li>Run <tt>make menuconfig</tt> (or equivalent) and select <tt>Software
Suspend 2</tt> then <tt>Image Storage - Swapwriter</tt> and also the <tt>LZF
Page Transformer</tt>. Compile in debugging too unless you are squeezed for
space in your kernel image.</li>

<li>Recompile. Meanwhile, add to your kernel's boot command-line the string
<tt>resume2=swap:/dev/hdaX</tt> where hdaX is your swap partition. This will
tell the kernel where to suspend to, and to check that swap partition for a suspend image upon resuming. If none is found, boot continues normally. While
you're here, it's also worthwhile adding a second boot menu option that has the
<tt>resume2=</tt> parameter <i>as well as</i> a <tt>noresume2</tt> parameter.
Booting with this will tell the kernel to ignore the suspend image, revert the
swap partition back, and boot normally. Use this in case of emergencies.</li>

<li>Reboot.</li>

<li>Enable the use of the Escape key to abort a suspend by running <tt>echo 1
&gt; /proc/software_suspend/enable_escape</tt> (disabled by default for security).</li>

<li>Activate a suspend by running <tt>echo &gt; /proc/software_suspend/activate</tt></li>

<li>If all went well your machine should save it's memory to disk (the swap
parition specified earlier) and power off</li>

<li>Power on your machine, and it should resume from the given swap partition and
all should be happy</li>

<li>If it doesn't work, the general procedure is to try booting with <tt>init
S</tt> and see if it works there. Then add things one by one until you find the
driver that breaks it.</li>

</ol>
