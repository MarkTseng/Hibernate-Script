# WARNING: No attempt is made to preserve this file upon upgrades.
#          The file format may also change between hibernate script versions.
#          It is recommended that you enter any modules you wish to unload
#          into hibernate.conf.
# 
# The syntax of each line in this file is "module name [...]" where [...] is
# a sequence of minimum/maximum kernel version pairs that the module is
# incompatible with. For example:
#     usb-ehci 2.4.0 2.4.25 2.6.0 2.6.2
# (would indicate that usb-ehci was incompatible in 2.4 until 2.4.25, and in
# 2.6 until 2.6.2 - example only!)
#
# A module without any versions is always considered unsuspendable.
#
# If a line is prefixed with an '@' sign, then the versions are interpreted
# as the module version (as reported by modinfo) instead of the kernel version.
# Unversioned modules (modules with no version: line shown in modinfo) are
# always unloaded if listed, regardless of the version range.
#
# This format has some limitations - it does not take into account Software
# Suspend 2 versions (which may include driver updates).
