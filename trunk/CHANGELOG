1.96 (?? ??? ????)
 - Add support for rename of /sys/power/suspend2/resume2 to .../resume,
   matching Suspend2 release 2.2.10.2 and later.
 - Cope with clock going backwards when considering LAST_RESUME_WAIT
   (Thomas de Schampheleire)

   s2ram (mainly for Intel chipsets) (Ricardo Salvetti, Enrico Tassi; Debian
   bug #427684).
 - Add SwitchToTextModeOnResume option. Unlike SwitchToTextMode, which
   switches, hibernates, and returns to X on resume, this option waits
   until after the resume, then switches to text mode and then back to X (Joey
   Hess; Debian bug #420400, #420401).
 - scriptlets.d/network: run ifup in the background on Debian/Ubuntu to avoid

   Hess (Debian bug #430148).

   them go offline/online (thanks Norbert Buchmuller; Debian bug #427376).

   Tassi; Debian bug #416967).

   for Suspend2 support (and rmmod loaded ones post-resume). (Jens Gustedt)
   Modified by Nigel Cunningham.
 - Allow for distribution specific patches. (Alon Bar-Lev)
 - Don't load kernel modules when installing or doing --help. (Alon Bar-Lev)

 [martin f. krafft]
 - Added a new scriptlet to restore the brightness of GFX cards on resume
   (Joey Hess; Debian bug #384140).
 - Use /proc/net/dev instead of ifconfig to enumerate network devices, because
   the latter would ignore madwifi interfaces.
 - Improved ususpend method. Now supports USuspendRamForce (boolean) to pass
   the -f option to s2ram. Also tests with s2ram's -n option if s2ram is used
   and the option is not set. I also made disk.conf and ram.conf prefer the
   uswsusp methods, if they are available. If you do not want to use them, use
   the sysfs-{ram,disk}.conf files, which are the former ram.conf and
   disk.conf files.
 - Added scriptlet to remount /boot read-only if /boot is a separate
   partition, contains an XFS filesystem, hibernate was asked to update the
   Grub menu file, and this feature has not been disabled in the configuration
   file (Debian bugs #317479, #317479, #386623). Also added README.xfs to
   document caveats for users of the XFS filesystem.
 - Added ath_pci to blacklisted modules (see Debian bug #383169).

   (Debian bug #381903).

 - Changed vbetool scriptlet to log stderr output to log file, and only let
   output through to real stderr if verbosity >=2 is selected (Debian bug
   #381927).

1.08 (13 May 2005 - "Black Floody Friday")

 - Make fbsplash/bootsplash automatically select on SwitchToTextMode.
 - Remove spurious VT switches (also means fbsplash should be seamless between
   hibernate script and userui).
